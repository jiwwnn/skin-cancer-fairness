Regular screenings and prompt evaluation of any concerning skin changes are crucial for early detection and successful treatment of skin cancer in individuals with Fitzpatrick type 2 skin.","Based on the symptoms you have described, including bleeding and elevation of the lesion, along with the size being 13.0mm horizontally and 10.0mm vertically, there is cause for concern. Lesions that bleed and are larger than 6mm in diameter, especially when elevated, can be indicative of skin cancer. Given these characteristics, it is important to consider the possibility of malignancy and further evaluate the lesion through a biopsy or consultation with a dermatologist to rule out skin cancer. Early detection and intervention are key in ensuring effective treatment and positive outcomes for patients with suspicious lesions."
