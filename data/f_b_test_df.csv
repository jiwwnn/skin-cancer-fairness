The lesion, as observed, is raised and exhibits signs of bleeding and chronic irritation, contributing to the patient's complaints of pain and itching. Additionally, the surface appears to be ulcerated and crusty, suggesting a degree of elevation and changing morphology, although specific growth metrics are unknown.

The lesion's coloration includes a pronounced red center surrounded by a pale, flaky border, which contrasts starkly with the patient's naturally fair background skin. Considering the clinical presentation and symptomatology—specifically the bleeding, pain, and significant size—this lesion fits the profile of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a type of malignant skin cancer. BCC, though commonly localized and slow to metastasize, warrants prompt medical attention due to its potentially destructive nature.

The lesion has shown significant and notably recent changes and growth, despite not causing any itching, pain, or bleeding. 

The visually distinct lesion has an irregular shape and a starkly uneven border with multiple dark hues, indicating variegation of color from dark brown to almost black in some areas. This irregularity and color variance, along with its size, and the label 'MEL', strongly suggest that the lesion is malignant melanoma. Given the malignancy and its requirements for timely intervention, it is crucial to emphasize the seriousness of the situation to the patient and recommend immediate further diagnostic procedures to confirm the condition and begin appropriate treatment.
